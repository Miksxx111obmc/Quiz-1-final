      <p><span class="detail-title">Name:</span> Bitcoin</p>
      <p><span class="detail-title">Definition:</span> Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without the need for an intermediary like a bank. It operates on a technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and are added to the blockchain, making them secure and transparent. Bitcoin is often referred to as a cryptocurrency because it uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. It was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. </p>

    <div class="crypto-details">
      <p><span class="detail-title">Name:</span> Ethereum</p>
      <p><span class="detail-title">Definition:</span> Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Ether is used as "fuel" to power these applications and to pay for transaction fees (also known as gas fees) within the Ethereum network. It is a digital asset similar to Bitcoin, but unlike Bitcoin, Ether also plays a critical role in the operation of the Ethereum network, incentivizing miners (or validators, in Ethereum's proof-of-stake model) to process and validate transactions. Ether was introduced in 2015 by Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin, and is one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies in the world.

    <div class="crypto-details">
      <p><span class="detail-title">Name:</span> Ripple</p>
      <p><span class="detail-title">Definition:</span> Ripple (XRP) is both the name of a digital payment protocol and the cryptocurrency associated with it. Ripple is designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers between financial institutions. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are decentralized networks, Ripple (the company) operates with a consensus algorithm that involves trusted validators, rather than mining or proof-of-work, making it more energy-efficient and scalable.

XRP is the digital asset used within the Ripple network to facilitate transactions. It acts as a bridge currency to enable seamless exchange between different fiat currencies, improving the liquidity and speed of cross-border transactions. XRP can also be used for transferring funds between parties in real time, without the need for intermediaries.

Ripple's primary goal is to streamline the global payments system, offering banks and financial institutions an alternative to traditional payment networks, like SWIFT.</p>
